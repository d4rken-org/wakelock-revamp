# Privacy policy

This is the privacy policy for the Android app "Wakelock Revamp - PowerManager" by Matthias Urhahn (darken).

## Preamble

I do not collect, share or sell personal information.

Send a [quick mail](mailto:support@darken.eu) if you have questions.

My underlying privacy principle is the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).

## READ_PHONE_STATE

If the user wants it, the app can acquire a wakelock for the duration of a phone call.
To know when a phone call begins and when it ends it requires the permission `READ_PHONE_STATE`.
