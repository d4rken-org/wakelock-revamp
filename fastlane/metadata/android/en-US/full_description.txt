Wake Lock gives you access to Android's Power- and WifiManager.
You can use it on any Android phone or tablet.

Examples of what it can do for you:
‚Ä¢ Force the PowerManager to keep the screen on
‚Ä¢ Have the CPU still running in standby mode
‚Ä¢ Ensure the Wifi connection keeps running at full performance
‚Ä¢ Keep the screen on in full brightness or dimmed mode during movies
‚Ä¢ Override power saving measures if they are causing issues

This is the modernized version of my app "WakeLock - PowerManager".

What the permissions are used for:
‚Ä¢ WAKE_LOCK, to obviously be allowed to aquire wakelocks.
‚Ä¢ RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED, to start the app after device reboots.
‚Ä¢ READ_PHONE_STATE, to act on start/ending calls, allowing the app to aquire a lock just for the duration of the call.
‚Ä¢ INTERNET, for automatic crash tracking. There is an option to disable this, but why would you üôÅ?
